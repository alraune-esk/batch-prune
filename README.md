# batch-prune

Fine-grained image classification is an important task with
applications in tasks such as object detection and species identication.
Networks trained for fine-grained image classification are large and con-
sume exorbitant amounts of computational resources due to the nature of
the task. In this paper we expand upon the usage of a feed forward neural
network for this classification task using the synthetic dataset Vehicle-X.
We apply network reduction and pruning methods to explore the potential for such networks to be limited in their computational expense. In
this paper we propose a method as an indicator for the robustness of
pruning methods and a batch pruning method to achieve more robust
pruning when compared to previous research. We find that with batch
pruning we can reduce the computational complexity of our model to
33.2% of its original complexity with a sacrifice of 10% accuracy.


Included in this repo are the finegrained labels, vehicle types, jupyter notebook with code and the research paper.
Access to the dataset is restricted and so will not be noted here.
